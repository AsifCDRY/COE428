# COE428
This repository contains all the projects I have done in this course (Engineering Algorithms and Data Structures).
The most notable project is either lab 4 or lab 5.

Lab 4 deals with finite state machines. 
It focuses on changing the elements in the machine, removing elements, and making elements point to another element that it wasn't originally pointing to.
If there is an element that is unreachable, i.e. there are no elements pointing to it, it is put in garbage and deleted from the FSM.

Lab 5 focuses on XML Heap.
